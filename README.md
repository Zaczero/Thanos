Mass-revert extension designed for [osm-revert](https://github.com/Zaczero/osm-revert).

There is no public tutorial available on how to use this tool.
Its intended users are solely the DWG team.
The reason is that it's too easy to accidentally break something while using it.
For everyday use, I suggest exploring the base https://revert.monicz.dev project.
